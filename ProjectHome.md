This software is designed to support Amateur Radio Field Day Operations by providing a robust multiplatform networked distributed logging database and information service. It ties all the stations together via the network and coordinates the logs, bands and modes of operation. Stations can be added or removed from the network in real time without affecting the integrity of the net.

This is a complete rewrite of WB6ZQZ's Field Day Logging program. It is nearly 20 years old (in 2002), but this new version has many new features, primary of which is the ability to synchronize the logfile database across a network in a peer to peer fashion, avoiding single points of failure.  The expectation is that a wireless network will be used.
